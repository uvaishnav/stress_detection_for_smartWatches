## üîç Key Findings

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Label Distribution
- Highly imbalanced: 91.9% no stress (0), 5.6% low stress (1), 1.6% medium stress (2), 0.8% high stress (3)
- Different datasets have different label distributions:

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Signal Quality and Processing
- Original BVP signal has low correlation with processed signals (0.11-0.19)
- Processed signals (cleaned, smoothed, denoised) are highly correlated with each other (0.90-0.96)
- Signal quality metrics are relatively consistent across stress levels
- Only about 4.6% of samples have detected systolic peaks or dicrotic notches

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Physiological Metrics and Stress
- **Heart Rate**: Minimal variation across stress levels (85.9-86.9 BPM)
- **Pulse Amplitude**: Decreases with stress level (24.2 for level 0 vs 15.1 for level 3)
- **Signal Quality**: Slightly increases with stress level (0.514 to 0.520)
- **Cardiac Energy**: Slightly increases with stress level (0.9976 to 0.9981)
- **SNR**: Increases with stress level (0.066 to 0.085)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Correlations with Stress Level
- **Positive correlations**: SNR (0.090), cardiac energy (0.085), signal quality (0.065)
- **Negative correlations**: Pulse amplitude (-0.078), motion burst (-0.028)
- Heart rate and IBI show very weak correlations with stress level

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Device and Skin Tone Effects
- Signal quality metrics are consistent across devices and skin tones
- Noise level varies by device (apple_watch: 0.064, galaxy_watch: 0.096, clean: 0.000)
- Stress level distribution is identical across skin tones

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Motion Effects
- Motion bursts are associated with lower signal quality (0.507 vs 0.515)
- Motion bursts are associated with lower cardiac energy (0.9967 vs 0.9976)
- Motion bursts are associated with lower SNR (0.046 vs 0.068)
