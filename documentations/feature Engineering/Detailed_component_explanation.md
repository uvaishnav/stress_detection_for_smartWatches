## üõ†Ô∏è 5.1 BaseFeatureExtractor

- **Purpose:**  
  The `BaseFeatureExtractor` is an abstract base class that defines the common interface and functionality for all feature extractors in the system. It provides standard methods for creating sliding windows from time series data and extracting features from those windows, ensuring consistent behavior across different feature extraction techniques.

- **Usage Example:**  
  ```python
  # BaseFeatureExtractor cannot be instantiated directly as it's an abstract class
  # Instead, a concrete subclass would be used like this:
  extractor = TimeDomainExtractor(window_size=300, overlap=0.5, sampling_rate=30)
  windows = extractor.create_windows(ppg_signal)
  features_df = extractor.extract_features_from_windows(windows)
  ```

- **Parameters & Returns:**  
  | Parameter    | Type            | Description                                                  |
  |--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
  | window_size  | int             | Size of the window in samples (default: 300, which is 10s at 30Hz) |
  | overlap      | float           | Overlap between consecutive windows as a fraction (default: 0.5) |
  | **Returns**  |                 |                                                              |
  | Windows      | List[np.ndarray]| List of numpy arrays, each representing a window of the signal |
  | Features     | pd.DataFrame    | DataFrame containing the extracted features, with one row per window |

- **Internal Workflow:**  
  - üìã Calculates the appropriate step size based on window size and overlap  
  - üåê Creates overlapping windows from the input data  
  - üõ†Ô∏è Provides a framework for feature extraction from these windows  
  - üîç The abstract `extract_features` method must be implemented by subclasses to define domain-specific feature extraction logic  

- **Dependencies:**  
  - `numpy` for array operations  
  - `pandas` for DataFrame manipulation  
  - `ABC` and `abstractmethod` from the `abc` module for defining the abstract interface  
  - `typing` module for type hints
