# üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering Plan for Stress Detection

Based on our EDA findings, we'll implement a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline to extract meaningful features from the cleaned physiological signals. This plan outlines the specific features to be extracted, the implementation approach, and the expected outcomes.

## üìã Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Window-Based Feature Extraction

We'll use a sliding window approach to extract features from the time series data. Based on our EDA, we'll use windows of different sizes to capture both short-term and long-term patterns.

**Window Sizes:**
- Short-term: 5 seconds (150 samples at 30Hz)
- Medium-term: 30 seconds (900 samples)
- Long-term: 60 seconds (1800 samples)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a windowing function that extracts overlapping windows from the time series
2. Apply feature extraction functions to each window
3. Aggregate features across windows using appropriate statistics

### Phase 2: Physiological Feature Extraction

#### 2.1 Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Features
- **SDNN**: Standard deviation of NN intervals
- **RMSSD**: Root mean square of successive differences
- **pNN50**: Percentage of successive NN intervals that differ by more than 50ms
- **HRV Triangular Index**: Total number of NN intervals divided by the height of the histogram
- **TINN**: Triangular interpolation of NN interval histogram

#### 2.2 Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) Features
- **Pulse Rate Variability**: Variation in pulse rate over time
- **Pulse Amplitude Variability**: Variation in pulse amplitude
- **Pulse Width Variability**: Variation in pulse width
- **Pulse Rise Time**: Time from trough to peak
- **Pulse Fall Time**: Time from peak to trough
- **Dicrotic Notch Position**: Relative position of dicrotic notch
- **Augmentation Index**: Ratio of late systolic peak to early systolic peak

#### 2.3 Signal Quality Features
- **Signal Quality Index**: Composite measure of signal quality
- **SNR-weighted metrics**: Features weighted by local SNR
- **Motion-free segments**: Features extracted from segments without motion artifacts

### Phase 3: Statistical Features

For each physiological signal (bvp, bvp_cleaned, bvp_smoothed, bvp_denoised), we'll extract:

- **Central Tendency**: Mean, median, mode
- **Dispersion**: Standard deviation, variance, range, IQR
- **Shape**: Skewness, kurtosis
- **Extrema**: Min, max, peak-to-peak amplitude
- **Percentiles**: 10th, 25th, 75th, 90th percentiles
- **Rate of Change**: First and second derivatives (mean, std, max)

### Phase 4: Spectral Features

Using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and wavelet analysis:

- **Frequency Bands Power**:
  - Very Low Frequency (VLF): 0.0033-0.04 Hz
  - Low Frequency (LF): 0.04-0.15 Hz
  - High Frequency (HF): 0.15-0.4 Hz
- **Spectral Ratios**: LF/HF ratio, normalized LF, normalized HF
- **Spectral Entropy**: Measure of signal complexity
- **Dominant Frequency**: Frequency with highest power
- **Spectral Edge Frequency**: Frequency below which 95% of power resides
- **Wavelet Coefficients**: Energy in different wavelet scales

### Phase 5: Nonlinear Features

- **Sample Entropy**: Measure of complexity/regularity
- **Approximate Entropy**: Measure of unpredictability
- **Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)**: Long-range correlations
- **Poincar√© Plot Metrics**: SD1, SD2, SD1/SD2 ratio
- **Recurrence Quantification Analysis**: Recurrence rate, determinism, entropy

### Phase 6: Contextual Features

- **Subject-Normalized Features**: Features normalized by subject baseline
- **Device-Specific Features**: Features that account for device differences
- **Dataset-Specific Features**: Features that account for dataset differences
- **Motion Context Features**: Features that incorporate motion information

## üìä Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction

After extracting the comprehensive feature set, we'll implement:

1. **Correlation Analysis**: Remove highly correlated features
2. **Feature Importance**: Use tree-based models to identify important features
3. **Mutual Information**: Capture nonlinear relationships with target
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving variance
5. **t-SNE Visualization**: Visualize feature space in 2D/3D

## üîÑ Implementation Workflow

1. **Create Feature Extraction Functions**: Implement modular functions for each feature type
2. **Build Windowing Pipeline**: Create sliding window functionality
3. **Extract Features in Batches**: Process data in manageable chunks
4. **Validate Feature Quality**: Check feature distributions and correlations with target
5. **Create Feature Store**: Save extracted features in an efficient format
6. **Document Feature Definitions**: Create comprehensive feature documentation

## üìà Expected Outcomes

- **Feature Matrix**: A comprehensive set of ~200-300 features
- **Feature Documentation**: Detailed description of each feature
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Understanding of which features are most predictive
- **Reduced Feature Set**: A curated set of 50-100 most informative features
- **Visualization**: 2D/3D visualizations of the feature space

## üß™ Validation Strategy

- **Cross-Validation**: Subject-wise and dataset-wise cross-validation
- **Feature Stability**: Assess feature stability across subjects and devices
- **Predictive Power**: Evaluate feature sets with simple models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Ablation Studies**: Measure impact of removing feature groups
