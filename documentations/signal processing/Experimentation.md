### 🧐 Analysis
Our advanced cardiac enhancement techniques achieved exceptional results, with an SNR well above our target of 10 dB while maintaining physiologically plausible signal characteristics.

![Frequency Domain Analysis](../../images/frequency_analysis.png)

> **Callout:** This two-panel visualization shows the time domain comparison (top) and power spectral density (bottom) of the original and cleaned signals. The dramatic peak in the cardiac band (0.8-4.0 Hz) of the cleaned signal demonstrates our selective enhancement of physiologically relevant frequencies, explaining the high SNR achieved.

## ⚖️ 9. SNR vs. Amplitude Preservation Tradeoff

One of our key findings was the relationship between SNR and amplitude preservation.

![SNR vs. Amplitude Preservation Tradeoff](../../images/snr_amplitude_tradeoff.png)

> **Callout:** This scatter plot shows the relationship between SNR and amplitude preservation across our experiments. The conventional approach (red trend line) suggests that higher SNR comes at the cost of poorer amplitude preservation. Our final solution (yellow point) breaks this tradeoff, achieving both excellent SNR (20.68 dB) and good amplitude preservation (ratio ~0.85).

### 💡 Key Insight
Conventional filtering approaches force a tradeoff between SNR and amplitude preservation. Our advanced cardiac-specific processing techniques achieved excellent SNR without sacrificing amplitude fidelity.
