- **Inter-Module Dependencies:**  
  List modules or files that this module interacts with or depends on.  
  _Example:_  
  - Depends on `data_loading` for raw data ingestion.  
  - Feeds into `data_preparation` and `signal_processing`.

- **Workflow Diagram:**  
  (Insert a flowchart/diagram that illustrates the module’s internal workflow and its connections with other modules.)  
  _Placeholder: Insert diagram here (e.g., using Mermaid )._

## 5. Detailed Component Documentation
For each significant component (class, function, or method), include:

### 5.1 [Component Name]
(this can be lengthy as required but should be clear to understand properly)
- **Purpose:**  
Explain what this component is responsible for.

- **Usage Example:**  
```python
# Example usage
instance = ComponentName(param1, param2)
result = instance.perform_action(data)
```
Parameters & Returns:
Parameter	Type	Description
param1	Type	Brief description.
param2	Type	Brief description.
Returns	Type	Description
result	Type	What the output represents.

Internal Workflow:
Describe the sequence of operations inside the component.
"The function first validates input data, then applies [specific algorithm], and finally returns the processed data."

Dependencies:
List any external libraries, modules, or functions that this component relies on.
