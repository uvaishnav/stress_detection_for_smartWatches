# Smartwatch-Based Stress Detection System

## Problem Statement
**Develop a reliable stress detection model using limited smartwatch sensors (PPG, accelerometer) that:**
1. Achieves >85% accuracy without EDA/temperature sensors
2. Works across Apple Watch & Samsung devices
3. Operates in real-time with <200ms latency
4. Consumes <3% battery/hour during continuous monitoring

## Key Considerations
- **Sensor Limitations**: No direct EDA, low-resolution PPG (30Hz vs research 1000Hz)
- **Context Variability**: Different stress patterns during exercise vs office work
- **Personalization**: Individual baseline variance in HRV/physiological responses
- **Ethical Compliance**: GDPR-compliant data handling, mental health safeguards

## Major Challenges
1. **Signal Quality**: Motion artifacts in PPG during daily activities
2. **Feature Extraction**: Deriving stress indicators from limited sensor data
3. **Model Efficiency**: Balancing accuracy vs power consumption
4. **Cross-Device Generalization**: Consistent performance across watch brands
